## Multi-Output Distributional Fairness via Post-Processing

Official implementations of the algorithms proposed in paper "[Multi-Output Distributional Fairness via Post-Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00553)" 

Credit: The code is built on the package "[Free-Support-Barycenters](https://github.com/jvlindheim/free-support-barycenters)"
### Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:GangLii/TAB.git
pip install POT numpy scipy matplotlib sklearn
```

### Examples 
We provide two examples to show how to apply our algorithms to post-processing. Please refer to `Toy Example.ipynb` and `Example for CelebA.ipynb` for details.
